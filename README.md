My girlfriend was staining lots of different pieces of wood, and each needed the stain to set for five minutes. While she was waiting, she would start another piece, which would then start its own five minute timer.

I had enough of manually tracking the offsets and restarts, so I wrote this little tool.

Serve it with any simple webserver. You can start multiple timers of different lengths and get an alert when each one completes.
